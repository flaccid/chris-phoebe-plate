Khua Kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) is one of the darlings of southern Thai cuisine. This recipe isn't traditional, but rather a quick method to reach a similar pinnacle. See [Mark Weins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wiens)' [recipe](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-khua-kling-recipe/) for the traditional method and make the [southern thai curry paste](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/how-to-make-southern-thai-curry-paste/) yourself instead of using canned.

In this recipe, we take half a can of Thai red curry paste and half a can of Thai yellow curry paste. [Maesri](https://maesri.com.au/products/) recommended!

For the pork, use cuts that contain fat, i.e. avoid using lean fillets. I like to use scotch fillet and spare ribs from the supermarket.

# Ingredients

- 500g mince pork (best to grind yourself)
- 120g Thai curry paste (half red, half yellow)
- 50g lemongrass, finely shaved (about 2 stalks)
- 3 large red chillies, diagonally-sliced
- ~12 lime leaves, finely sliced (kaffir if possible)
- pinch of sugar (optional)
- 5 birdseye chilies (optional, garnish)

# Method

1. Prepare the lemongrass, finely shaving it with a knife; slice the red chillies diagonal; finely slice the lime leaves after removing the stems

2. Heat a woke to med-high heat, add the curry paste and fry for 5 minutes (mixing with a utensil) or until most moisture is removed and fairly dry

3. Add the minced pork to the wok and stir fry the mixing in the paste repeatedly until well combined, then add sugar (optional)

6. Once it is very well-combined and the pork is cooked-through, turn down and reduce further if there is too much moisture (more dry, the better)
7. Pour into a large serving bowl, then garnish with the remaining sliced lime leaves and birdseye chillies (w/ stems removed)
