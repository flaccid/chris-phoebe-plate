Khua Kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) is one of the darlings of southern Thai cuisine. This recipe isn't traditional, but rather a quick method to reach a similar pinnacle. See [Mark Weins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wiens)' recipe for the traditional method and make the [southern thai curry paste](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/how-to-make-southern-thai-curry-paste/).

In this recipe, we take half a can of Thai red curry paste and half a can of Thai yellow curry paste. [Maesri](https://maesri.com.au/products/) recommended!

# Ingredients

- 500g minced pork
- 120g thai curry paste (half red, half yellow)
- 50 g. lemongrass, finely shaved (about 2 stalks)
- 3 large red chillies, largely sliced
- ~12 lime leaves, finely sliced (kaffir if possible)
- pinch of sugar (optional)
- 6 birdseye chilies (optional, garnish)

# Method

1. Prepare the lemongrass, finely shaving it with a knife; cut the red chillies diagonal into quarters; finely slice the lime leaves after removing the stems
2. Heat a woke to med-high heat, then fry the curry paste for 5 minutes or until most moisture is removed and fairly dry
3. Add the minced pork to the wok and stir fry the meat mixing in the paste repeatedly until well combined, then add sugar (optional)
4. Add the lemongrass then stir fry for another few minutes
5. Add 3/4 of the lime leaves and the sliced chilli, stir fry for another minute or so
6. Once it all looks very well combined and the pork is cooked through, reduce further if there is too much moisture (more dry, the better)
7. Pour into a large serving bowl, then garnish with the remaining sliced lime leaves and birdseye chillies
